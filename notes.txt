- make GEI for TUM database
    - normal walking only
    - process each video in normal walking
    - given set start threshold for mask start GEI generation
    - when hit end threshold output the GEI into output directory with filename (filename_{figure}.png)
- visualise GEI
    - read in first 16 GEIs
    - display in 16x16 grid, Xlabel for each grid is the filename
- Run PCA
   - given K
   - read in GEI pngs, flatten and construct into single matrix
   - Run SVD on matrix with given K
   - write out basis vectors to PCA_basis directory and coefficients to PCA_output directory
- visualise PCA
   - Compare 3 or 4 original videos with PCA reconstruction
